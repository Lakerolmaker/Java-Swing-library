# Java Swing library

This is a very simple and easy to use Java - Swing library i made.

ItÂ´s uses coordinates to position the elements inside the frame.


The framework is dependent on one simple file,
[UI.java](https://github.com/Lakerolmaker/Java-Swing-library/blob/master/src/JackeLibrary/UI.java)
.

Simply add the file to your project and then add the reference "import JackeLibrary.UI;" ,
in the top of the import field.
